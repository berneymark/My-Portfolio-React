      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a software development graduate from Auckland University of
        Technology. I am seeking opportunities within the industry because my
        passion lies in delivering great products that users will enjoy. Also, I
        greatly enjoy the collaborative aspect of the role as I believe it's
        important for developers to be able to bounce off one another. This,
        along with my detailed oriented nature would make me a great fit for
        your team.
